        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p></p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An 8-ounce package of spaghetti should make 
                about eight servings.</li>

            <li>You'll need a pound of lean ground beef. 
                You can use a mix of ground beef and 
                ground turkey, if you prefer.</li>

            <li>Use a jar of store-bought spaghetti sauce</li>

            <li>Use a stick of sliced butter to prepare the pan 
                and to add richness and flavor to the baked 
                spaghetti.</li>

            <li>A mixture of cottage cheese, cream cheese, 
                and sour cream is essential for this decadent, 
                creamy spaghetti sauce. </li>

            <li>Shredded Cheddar cheese is the perfect 
                finishing touch for this million dollar spaghetti.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the spaghetti in salted water, then drain 
                and set aside.</li>

            <li>Cook the beef on the stove and discard the 
                grease. Transfer to a bowl and mix in the 
                spaghetti sauce. </li>

            <li>Prepare the baking dish, then spread half of 
                the noodles in the bottom. </li>

            <li>Top with the mixture of cottage cheese, cream 
                cheese, and sour cream.</li>

            <li>Cover with remaining spaghetti and butter.</li>

            <li>Pour the beef mixture over the spaghetti and 
                spread in an even layer.</li>

            <li>Bake for 30 minutes, top with Cheese, and 
                continue baking until the cheese is melted.</li>
        </ol>
